The application now:
- connects to the database with username and password
	- This is significant, as it means I can now start hooking up the database to the controller in order to update model data
- reads the rows in the database, and prints them to the java terminal.

Next Steps:
- have the read statement pass information in order to update an html view
- create a method for inserting data into the database, and then do the same thing as the read statement.

Also:
experimented with jquery a bit more.
- jquery is a uniform middle man between computer and server - this means that any computer anywhere just needs to download a browser, and they get a lot of functionality.

Further steps:
- have jquery send a 'get' request to a server instance, and have it update some simple values
- see what happens with post data
